Steps Did Until Now:
1. Updated node dependencies to latest version.
2. installed python as a dependency. for some reason it was not installed.
3. Installed node-gyp: npm install -g node-gyp Node.js native addon build tool
4. Configuring Python Dependency: 
                                    py --list-paths  # To see the installed Python versions
                                    set npm_config_python=C:\path\to\python.exe  # CMD
                                    $Env:npm_config_python="C:\path\to\python.exe"  # PowerShell
5. Installed Windows Build Tools: npm install --global --production windows-build-tools # For Windows resulted in error.
6. choco install python visualstudio2022-workload-vctools -y # For Windows
7. Ran a SCript for sqllite3:   cd my_node_addon, node-gyp configure, node-gyp configure --msvs_version=2015, node-gyp build
8. Npm install now works fine. 
npm uninstall babel-eslint
npm install sqlite3
