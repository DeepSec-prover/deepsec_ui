This file summarizes the most important changes between versions
of DeepSec UI.

Version 1.0.0 alpha rc2 (14/01/2020)
  
  - Fix a bug where symbolic link to `deepsec_api` would not work.
  - Improved selection of absolute path to `deepsec_api`

Version 1.0.0 alpha rc (14/01/2020)

  DeepSec UI requires DeepSec 2.0.x to run. 
  See https://github.com/DeepSec-prover/deepsec to download and install DeepSec 2.0.x. 
  Amongst the new features of both DeepSec and DeepSec UI:

  - Improved efficiency when verifying queries.
  - Support for "Eavesdrop", "Classic" and "Private" semantics (POST'17)
  for verifying trace equivalence.
  - Integration and improvements of session equivalence (CCS'19).
  - Recording of the result of your runs that can be displayed in DeepSec UI.
  - DeepSec UI supports all of DeepSec's abilities does but with a nice
  interface.
  - Interactive display of attacks for violated queries.

  - Attack and equivalence simulators in DeepSec UI for trace equivalence:
  when a trace equivalence query holds, you can select a trace on any of
  the two processes and request an equivalent trace; when violated there
  is an attack trace on one of the processes, and you can select any trace
  on the other process to see why they are not equivalent. Note that these
  simulators only work with trace equivalence and not session equivalence.
